# T20-World-Cup-Analysis-2022This project presents an analysis of the T20 World Cup 2022, including statistical data on player performance, team strategies, and match predictions. The data for this analysis was collected from various sources, including CricInfo, cricket databases, CodeBasics, and other reputable online resources.
